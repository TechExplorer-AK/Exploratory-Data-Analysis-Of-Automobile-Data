# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Of-Automobile-Data
## Automobile Exploratory Analysis Project
### For this project we will analyze the Automobile dataset. The dataset contains the following fields:

* symboling: Represents the insurance risk rating of the car (-3 to +3).
* normalized-losses: Represents the average loss payment per insured vehicle year.
* make: The manufacturer or brand of the car.
* fuel-type: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., diesel, gas).
* aspiration: The method by which air is delivered to the engine (e.g., standard, turbo).
* num-of-doors: The number of doors on the car (e.g., two, four).
* body-style: The body style of the car (e.g., sedan, hatchback).
* drive-wheels: The type of drive wheels (e.g., front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive).
* engine-location: The location of the engine in the car (e.g., front, rear).
* wheel-base: The distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels.
* length: The length of the car.
* width: The width of the car.
* height: The height of the car.
* curb-weight: The weight of the car without passengers or cargo.
* engine-type: The type of engine (e.g., dohc, ohcv).
* num-of-cylinders: The number of cylinders in the engine (e.g., four, six).
* engine-size: The size of the engine in cubic centimeters (cc).
* fuel-system: The type of fuel system (e.g., mpfi, 2bbl).
* bore: The diameter of each cylinder in the engine.
* stroke: The distance the piston travels in each cycle.
* compression-ratio: The ratio of the maximum to minimum volume in the engine's combustion chamber.
* horsepower: The power generated by the engine.
* peak-rpm: The maximum revolutions per minute of the engine.
* city-mpg: The miles per gallon (MPG) in city driving conditions.
* highway-mpg: The miles per gallon (MPG) in highway driving conditions.
* price: The price of the car (target variable for analysis).
